# coral-counterfactual

This repository corresponds to the model and analysis presented in Friedman and Darling, 2025 (forthcoming)

We compiled a large global dataset of coral cover observations and apply statistical modelling to provide a first global model of total coral cover and counterfactual predictions, and show how these tools can be used to assess the impact of conservation interventions on coral reefs using case studies in three countries. Specifically, our objectives were to: 
- i) develop a high-performance model of global hard coral cover from publicly available coral cover estimates and social-environmental global data layers
- ii) create a global predicted layer of coral cover based on current information
- iii) create a global counterfactual prediction of ‘unmanaged’ coral cover to compare to observed impact within managed areas, and
- iv) demonstrate the application of these models to conservation with case studies to measure conservation impact.

We make all data layers and source code freely available (see Data Availability) to bridge the counterfactual knowledge gap and provide practitioners with novel resources to evaluate the impacts of coral reef conservation in their local, regional, or global scales.

- Use the check boxes to toggle between three conditions:
-- "pct_hardcoral_obs": cells are filled based on survey data
-- "pct_hardcoral_s0_current": model predictions are displayed for all cells based on current observed conditions
-- "pct_hardcoral_s1_no_mgmt": model predictions are displayed for all cells based on the "no management" scenario

## Data
The globally gridded dataset is freely available for public use (Friedman and Darling 2024; [doi:10.5063/F1GX491S](https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/view/doi%3A10.5063%2FF1GX491S))
